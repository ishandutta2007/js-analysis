JS Analysis
===========

**Warning**: This is a repository with quick-and-dirty code analysis tools which I use for my own research. The documentation is limited and support cannot be provided. Use at your own risk!

At least NodeJS 13 is required to run these scripts.

beautify.js
-----------

This tool will beautify JavaScript files in place while also giving each variable a unique word-like name.

unwebpack.js
------------

This tool can unpack some types of Webpack bundles, putting individual JavaScript modules into a directory. The modules will be beautified the way `beautify.js` would do it.
